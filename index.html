			<p class="subtag">Paced Self-Learning Models</p>
			<p class="text-small2">WhiteBoard distance education uses a paced format similar to traditional campus-based models in which learners commence and complete a course at the same time. Some institutions offer self-paced programs that allow for continuous enrollment, and the length of time to complete the course is set by the learner's time.  The self-paced nature of the programming, though, is an unfamiliar model for many students and can lead to excessive procrastination, resulting in course incompletion. skill, and commitment levels. Self-paced courses are almost always offered asynchronously.  Finally, paced models allow students to readily form communities of inquiry and to engage in collaborative work.</p>

			<p class="subtag">Benefits of Joining WhiteBoard</p>
			<p class="text-small2">Distance learning can expand access to education and training for both general populace and businesses since its flexible scheduling structure lessens the effects of the many time-constraints imposed by personal responsibilities and commitments. Devolving some activities off-site alleviates institutional capacity constraints arising from the traditional demand on institutional buildings and infrastructure. As a result, more classes can be offered and enable students to enroll in more of their required classes on time and prevent delayed graduation. Furthermore, there is the potential for increased access to more experts in the field and to other students from diverse geographical, social, cultural, economic, and experiential backgrounds.</p>
